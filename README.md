  main Method

    description: Entry point of the program. Calls FindAverage to calculate the sum of elements in a sample array and then divides it by the length of the array to find the average.
    Output: Prints the average of elements in the array.

**PROBLEM 3:**
  isPrime Method O(n)

    description: Recursively checks if a given number is prime by iterating from divisor down to 1 and checking if any of them divides n evenly.
    Parameters: n - the number to check for primality, divisor - the current divisor being checked.
    Returns: true if the number is prime, false otherwise.

  main Method

    description: Entry point of the program. Takes user input for a number and then calls isPrime to determine if it's prime or not.
    Input: Accepts user input for a number to check for primality.
    Output: Prints whether the entered number is prime or not.

**PROBLEM 4:**
  Factorial Method O(n)

    description: Recursively calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer n.
    Parameters: n - the number for which factorial is to be calculated.
    Returns: The factorial of the input number.

**PROBLEM 5:**
  Fibonacci Method O(2^n)

    description: Recursively calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
    Parameters: n - the index of the Fibonacci number to calculate.
    Returns: The nth Fibonacci number.

**PROBLEM 6:**
  power Method O(2^n)

    description: Recursively calculates the power of a number by multiplying it n times.
    Parameters: a - the base number, n - the exponent.
    Returns: The result of a raised to the power of n.

**PROBLEM 7:**
  reverseArray Method O(n)

    description: Recursively reverses the elements of an integer array between specified start and end indices.
    Parameters: arr - the integer array to be reversed, start - the starting index of the subarray, end - the ending index of the subarray.

**PROBLEM 8:**
  isDigits  O(n)

    description: Recursively checks if a string consists only of digits.
    Parameters: s - the string to be checked, index - the current index being checked in the string.
    Returns: true if all characters in the string are digits, false otherwise.

**PROBLEM 9:**
  binom Method O(2^n)

    Description: Recursively calculates the binomial coefficient, also known as "n choose k", which represents the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n distinct items.
    Parameters: n - the total number of items, k - the number of items to choose.
    Returns: The binomial coefficient, calculated recursively using Pascal's identity.

**PROBLEM 10:**
  gcd Method O(log(min(a, b)))

    Description: Recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using Euclid's algorithm.
    Parameters: a and b - the two integers for which the GCD is to be calculated.
    Returns: The GCD of the two input integers.

  main Method

    Description: Entry point of the program. Calls gcd to calculate the GCD of two sample integers (32 and 48) and prints the result.
    Output: Prints the GCD of the two sample integers.
